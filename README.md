## About
- This project is directed to recognise hand gestures using convolution neural networks.
- Motive of this project is to reduce the communication gap for people with disability.

## Description
- Each Image is captured through webcam and a dataset is created for the model
- Dataset is taken and segregated into Training and Test data.
- For each alphabet there are 5 images captured to improve the acuracy of the model. 
- Dataset can be made large or small accordingly to the user requirements
- Convolution Neural Networks have been used here for better efficiency of the model.
 
## Libraries Used
- Numpy
- Pandas 
- Tensorflow
- Keras
- OpenCV
