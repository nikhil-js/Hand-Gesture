Hand gesture recognition 
This project is directed to recognise hand gestures using convolution neural networks.
Motive of this project is to reduce the communication gap between a deaf persona and a person with no disability.
There is a training dataset where all the images have been captured.
There is also a testing dataset provided to test the accuracy of the model.
For each alphabet there are 5 images captured to improve the acuracy of the model. Dataset can be made large or small accordingly to the use of the user
Convolution Neural Networks have been used here for better efficiency of the model.
This project is still in process as the major issue during this project was to use a 3d model to capture videos.
Using 3D model this problem can also be overcome.
I hope you like this projetc!
